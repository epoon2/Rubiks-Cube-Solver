# Rubik's Cube Solver

A program that can represent, manipulate, and solve Rubik's Cubes of various sizes.

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a Rubik's Cube solver that evolves with increasingly sophisticated algorithms:

1. **Phase 1**: Basic cube representation and move operations
2. **Phase 2**: Implementation of simple solving algorithms (BFS, A*)
3. **Phase 3**: Advanced solving techniques (Iterative Deepening, Kociemba's Algorithm)
4. **Phase 4**: GUI implementation and visualization

## Features (Planned)

- Cube representation for 2x2, 3x3, and larger cubes
- Move notation following standard Rubik's Cube conventions
- Multiple solving algorithms with varying efficiency
- Performance benchmarking
- Interactive GUI for cube manipulation and solution visualization

## Technologies

- Python for initial implementation and prototyping
- Java for more advanced solving algorithms and optimization
- JavaFX for GUI (planned)
